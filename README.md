# College_Projects
This repository contains some of the group projects that I have worked during my graduation. Explored several programming languages and technologies while building these projects. Not only they enhanced my learning new skills but also collaboration, team work and work-time management.

## Brief Description of Projects
#### e-Voting Machine
An electronic voting system built on Arduino Microcontroller chip and programmed in Python for easy voting procedure and result analysis. Requirments for the system are as folllow :
-	Programming Language Used : Python, C
-	Hardware Used : Arduino UNO
-	Components Used : Push buttons, Connecting Wires, Resistances(100k ohm), Breadboard
-	Software Used : Anaconda 2.7.x , Python 2.7.x , Arduino IDE
-	Modules Used : Serial , SQLite , Tkinter, tkMessageBox

#### Moodify
Song suggestions based on user's mood (Based on Machine Learning).

The major application of ‘Moodify’ is to suggest the music genres which are best fitted for the person’s mood at that time. The mood detection is done using image segregation. We have used Convolution Neural Network for image preprocessing and then detecting the mood. Our dataset model for now has be entrained for three basic emotions that are happiness, sadness and excitement. A photo of user is clicked that shows the mood of the user. And then the result is generated determining if the person is happy or sad or excited. After mood detection the user will choose whether he wants to use the offline mode or online mode of music recommendation. The mode will then direct the user to the recommended music playlist best suited for his mood. Then the user will select the song from the suggested list and the music player will play the song. Hence the user will be able to reach the music which he wants to listen without having to go through a boring process of searching the music himself.
